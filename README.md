This project aims to classify abdominal organs. The dataset consists of 58,830 2D images of body organ images based on 3D computed tomography (CT) images from Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS). We evaluate a KNN classifier and a CNN. The results indicate that the CNN improves performance by 10.36% with respect to the KNN classifier, reaching 87.36% accuracy, and making it a feasible alternative for automated classification.
