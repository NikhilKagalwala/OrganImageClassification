# OrganImageClassification
This project aims to classify abdominal organs. The dataset used consists of 58,830 2D images of body organs based on 3D computed tomography (CT) images from Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS). We evaluate a KNN classifier and a CNN. CNN improves performance by 10.36% with respect to the KNN classifier, reaching 87.36% accuracy.
